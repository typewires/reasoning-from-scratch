    "# Chapter 4: Improving Reasoning with Inference-Time Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Understand inference-time compute scaling as a way to improve accuracy without retraining\n",
    "- Implement chain-of-thought prompting to encourage step-by-step reasoning\n",
    "- Build self-consistency sampling with majority voting\n",
    "- Create flexible text generation with swappable sampling strategies (temperature, top-p)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 4 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inference-time scaling spends more compute during inference for better answers—no retraining needed\n",
    "- Two main techniques covered: chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency sampling\n",
    "- Chain-of-thought: \"Explain step by step\" prompts intermediate reasoning, improves accuracy but costs more tokens\n",
    "- Self-consistency: generate multiple answers, extract results, select most frequent via majority vote\n"
